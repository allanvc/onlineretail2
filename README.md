Transactions occurring for a UK-based and registered, non-store online retail 
between 01/12/2009 and 09/12/2011. This dataset is included in this package
with permission of the donor, Dr. Daqing Chen, and may be used only for 
non-commercial purposes.

The dataset consists of a data frame with eight variables:
* `Invoice`: A character indicating the invoice number, which is a 6-digit integral number 
uniquely assigned to each transaction. If this code starts with the letter 'c', 
it indicates a cancellation.
* `StockCode`: A character indicating the product (item) code, which is a 5-digit integral 
number uniquely assigned to each distinct product. It can be accompanied by a trailing 
uppercase letter.
* `Description`: A character indicating the Product (item) name.
* `Quantity`: A numeric indicating the quantities of each product (item) per transaction.
* `InvoiceDate`: A POSIXct indicating the invoice day and time when a transaction was generated.
* `Price`: A numeric indicating the product price per unit in sterling (Â£).
* `CustomerID`: A numeric indicating the customer number, which is a 5-digit integral number 
uniquely assigned to each customer.
* `Country`: A character indicating the name of the country where a customer resides.
